<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Igor Campos ðŸ˜ƒ</h1>
<h3 align="center"></h3>

I've been working professionally with software development for over a decade now, but had this tech & code passion since I was a kid.
I am the kind of guy that enjoys a challenge and rests pleased once it is all integrated and working properly. Most of my repositories here are just projects I did for
fun in my spare time and a couple of them are supporting tools for projects I've worked in.
